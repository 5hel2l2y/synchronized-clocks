# Synchronized Clocks

## Requirement

Create two synchronized clocks with the ability to adjust each clock's time. When the time on one clock is adjusted, the time on the other clock should be automatically synchronized. Please have one analog clock face and one digital clock face.

### Consider

* User interface of both clocks and functionality
* Incrementing time with both clocks
* Test implementation

## Future Implementation

* Tests
* Styling on the digital clock

## Run

```js
npm install && npm start
```
